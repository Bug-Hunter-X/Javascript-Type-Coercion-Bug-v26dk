# Javascript Type Coercion Bug This repository contains a simple Javascript program that demonstrates type coercion. Type coercion is the automatic conversion of one data type to another. In Javascript, this can lead to unexpected results if you are not aware of it. The program demonstrates the + operator's behavior when used with strings and numbers. When a number and a string are added together using +, Javascript converts the number to a string and concatenates the two strings. This can lead to unexpected results if you're not careful.  The solution demonstrates how to avoid this issue using type checking or other methods.
